== Parcels Exercise

1. Find the most efficient combination of 3kg and 5kg parcels required to make any shipment of 8kg or more. The app will accept input from a web form.

2. Output should either be a simple result view or for bonus points, rendered on the same page via AJAX without page refresh. So given 11, output should be:

  * One 5 kg parcels
  * Two 3 kg parcels

4. Input should be validated.
