== Parcels Exercise

1. Find the most efficient combination of 3kg and 5kg parcels required to make any shipment of 8kg or more. The app will accept input from a web form.

2. Output should either be a simple result view or for bonus points, rendered on the same page via AJAX without page refresh. So given 11, output should be:

3. 1 five kg parcels, 2 three kg parcels

4. Input should be validated.

5. Assume at least Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 3+. Please use TDD.
